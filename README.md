## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 for image uploads
- **API Style:** RESTful

### Frontend

- **Framework:** React, Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with `redux-persist` for a persistent global state.
- **Data Fetching:** Axios
- **Payment:** Stripe.js, PayPal React SDK

### Architecture

The project uses a **decoupled (or headless) architecture**. The backend is a standalone REST API that handles all business logic and data. The frontend is an independent Next.js application that consumes data from the backend API. This separation allows for independent development, scaling, and the ability to connect other clients (like a mobile app) in the future.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd MERN\ Commerce

# 2. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Create a .env file in the `backend` directory
#    (copy the contents from .env.example and fill in your values)
touch .env

# 5. Start the backend server
npm start
```
The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env.local file in the `frontend` directory
#    (copy the contents from .env.local.example and fill in your values)
touch .env.local

# 4. Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
