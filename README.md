## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 for image uploads
- **API Style:** RESTful

### Frontend

- **Framework:** React, Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with `redux-persist` for a persistent global state.
- **Data Fetching:** Axios
- **Payment:** Stripe.js, PayPal React SDK

### Architecture

The project uses a **decoupled (or headless) architecture**. The backend is a standalone REST API that handles all business logic and data. The frontend is an independent Next.js application that consumes data from the backend API. This separation allows for independent development, scaling, and the ability to connect other clients (like a mobile app) in the future.
